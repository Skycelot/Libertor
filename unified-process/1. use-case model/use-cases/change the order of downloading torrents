1. From the list of downloading torrents the user interchanges the torrent's relative order number with the previous or next one.
2. With the order number the torrents change their status.
If the status does change, the torrent that was queued starts with the other torrent's speed precedency and the torrent that was downloading stops and go to the queue.
3. If both torrents are downloading (not queued) they also change their speed precedency.
